## Navigating this skill tree

Skills structure is hierarchical. Each `SKILL.md` links to its sub-skills, and those links are the navigation mechanism; follow them rather than assembling paths yourself.

- Read the `SKILL.md` for the relevant skill, then follow its links to go deeper. This page lists the top two levels; skills nest up to four levels, and the deeper ones are reachable only through the links inside each `SKILL.md`.
- If you do not have a link to the skill you need, do not guess the path. Fetch the [complete index of every skill](https://skills.qdrant.tech/llms.txt), including the ones this page does not list, or search: https://skills.qdrant.tech/search?query=your+query+here
- When fetching `SKILL.md` files via a URL tool, preserve all Markdown links exactly as written. Do not paraphrase, summarize away, or omit URLs.
- Search returns a full skill with its links intact, so a hit can be acted on directly.
